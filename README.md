# So-You-Want-To-Pet-A-Squirrel

It’s a common desire. There’s only one problem: they’re fast. Our ancestors solved this through cunning traps or hand-raising a kitten (yes, really) from birth. Luckily, modern technology has graced us with a much less time-consuming solution: data-driven analytics. A few years ago, a group of people with frankly too much time on their hands spent several days walking through Central Park in New York City, recording every squirrel they saw.

Luckily for us, they also recorded if the squirrels attempted to approach them to ask for food. With this information, and a little bit of code in SQL and visualization in Tableau, we can determine the best time and place to find a pettable squirrel.
